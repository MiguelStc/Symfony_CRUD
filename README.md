<h1>Symfony 7 CRUD </h1>

This is a brief project dedicated to exploring Symfony 7. Throughout this, I delved into the  bassics by realising a CRUD app framework, utilizing Bootstrap to streamline my focus on understanding its fundamental concepts.

The idea was to display items from a database and verify if they are stored in the appropriate type of environment. Additionally, users should have the capability to add or delete items from the database.

<h3>Features</h3>
On the index page, the user can view every item in the database. Each item represents a different chemical compound. Additionally, on this same page, users can see where each compound is located and determine if it is in the correct place with the right type of compounds.
(SGH01 - SGH09)
For each item, there are buttons to edit or delete it. At the top of the page, there is a button to add a new item to the list along with a form.
